1) write a custom filter using angular js? syntax , explain for al the possibility of parameters
In AngularJS filters are added to format data. There are couple of different types of filters that AngularJS provides in order to transform data.
Few of the filters are currency, date, filter, json, limito, lowercase, number, orderBy and uppercase. 

Currency: is used to format a number to a currency format.
Ex1: 
In the below example, the output will come as Price: $100.00. The price is the expression followed by a pipe symbol and then come the filter currency.
<!doctype html>
<html >
  <head>
    <title>My Angular App</title>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.6/angular.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="PriceCtrl">

<h1>Price: {{ price | currency }}</h1>
</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('PriceCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.price = 100;
});
</script></body>
</html>

-> Filter: will select subset of items from an array.
Example:
<!doctype html>
<html >
  <head>
    <title>My Angular App</title>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.6/angular.min.js"></script>
  </head>
<body>
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="lang_Ctrl">

<ul>
  <li ng-repeat="x in languages| filter : 'j'">
    {{ x }}
  </li>
</ul>

</div>

<script>
angular.module('myApp', []).controller('lang_Ctrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.languages = [
        'JavaScript',
        'Go',
        'HTML',
        'CSS',
        'AngularJS',
        'C Sharp',
        'Cobol',
        'Java',
        'Jquery'
    ];
});
</script></body>
</html >
In this example, languages that have “j” alphabet in them will be selected. The output will be:
JavaScript
AngularJS
Java
Jquery


2) why do we use directives?
In AngularJS, the extension of HTML with new attributes is known as Directives. 
AngularJS has built-in directives which offers functionality to our applications and we can define our own directives as well. 
Few  built-in directives :
ng-app which initializes an AngularJS application,
ng-init which initializes application data,
ng-model which binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, etc) to application data. 

3) how to build custom directives (scope, restrict, link(scope, element, attrs), template and templateUrl)
In AngularJS, the extension of HTML with new attributes is known as Directives.
 Syntax for building custom directive is:
angular.module(‘myApp’).directive (dir1’, function () {

return {
restrict: ECAM
}
});

restrict : 'EACM'
E -- element
A -- attribute
C -- css class
M -- comment

Restrict property determines where a directive can be used as an element, attribute, CSS class, or comment.

Template property defines the content that should be output from the directive. 
Can include HTML, data binding expressions, and even other directives. 

TemplateURL property provides path to the template that should be used by the directive.
It can optionally contain a DOM element id when templates are defined in <script> tags. 

Controller property used to define the controller that will be associated with the directive template. 

Link property function used for DOM manipulation tasks. 

Scope property used to create a new child scope or an isolate scope. 
shared -- default
			--> it wil not have any independent scope. 
			--> it scope will refer to the controller scope
		isolate scope -- {}
			--> model would be indepdenet of parent scope,
			--> no inhertance of model from parent scope, or restricted access of model from parent scope.

isolate scope 
	@ -- read a value from attribute
	= -- read a model from attribute
	& -- read a function reference from attribute
